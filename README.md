**CORONA VIRUS - CONFIRMED CASES TIMELINE**

------

Given that thereâ€™s a pandemic going on right now, for this project I wanted to illustrated the evolution of the total number of confirmed cases since the beginning until now. The data used for this project is the one provided by Johns Hopkins University (now data is available as csv files in the [Johns Hopkins Github repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)), the data is available from 22, Jan, 2020.

**Visualization timeline**

For the plot I have used plotly as the main library, using choropleth map which is a type of thematic map where areas or regions are shaded in proportion to a given data variable.

**Libraries used:**

- Numpy
- Pandas 
- Plotly
